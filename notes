Class 1
Cucumber -

BDD - behavioral driven development

gherkin

group id - org.syntax
artifact id - hrmsb19

src -
    main - to develop the application
    test - to test the application

    delete main folder because we don't need it

    in test - we have
        java - for technical stuff
        resources - for non technical stuff

now we have - java, selenium, cucumber, apache, commons io


scenario - BDD -
the file where we write BDD scenarios, we call it feature file

In one user story - we have multiple test cases
similarly, in one feature file, we write multiple scenarios for that user story

 rules of steps - dont add any space or any char after implementing step definition
 dont write duplicate step def, just one step definition should exist
 you can call steps in feature multiple times, but in back-end there should be only one step
 definition


Search employee -

Search employee by id -
    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user enters valid username and password
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in
    When user clicks on PIM option
    And user clicks on employee list option
    When user enters valid employee id
    And user clicks on search button
    Then user see the employee information


we have scenarios written in feature file
we have step definitions in steps classes

all test scenarios are executing properly

we are calling methods from common methods class
we are using selenium webdriver from common methods class

runner class - it is considered as the most important class of cucumber

3 important classes in cucumber
feature file
step definition

runner class - we can execute all of the scenarios, some of the scenarios,
one of the scenarios from this class
we can generate all the step definitions in just one click
we can generate reports also from this class
we can separate scenarios also from this class

Class 2 -
recap -
cucumber -
feature file in which we write all the scenarios
step definition class where all the step definitions are available
runner class - all the test cases we execute from runner class

maven project -
artifact id - project name
group id - company name

main - development
test - to test the application
 test - java and resources - for all technical part we need java and for all
 non tech part we need resources

Background -
it allows us to write all duplicate steps in one feature file till the time flow is
not broken at one place.

once the flow is broken, we cannot write steps in background.
one background is applicable for one feature file it means for every feature file
background will be different

tags = if we need to execute specific scenarios, we use tag name here
we can add multiple tags to one scenario
we can give any name to tag

Hooks - in cucumber, hooks we use to mention pre condition and post condition
of the complete project. It means for all the feature files, we have common
pre condition and post condition such as opening the browser and closing the browser

RULE: Hooks class will be implemented under steps package

Background vs hooks -

hooks are applicable for complete project (all feature files)
background is applicable only for one feature file

in background we keep all the common steps for one feature file
in Hooks we keep only pre conditions and post conditions of the entire project

Data driven testing - when your one test case executes against multiple sets of data

Class 3
Recap -

background -

in one feature file, if we have some steps which are common across all the scenarios
then we can write them in background but only till the point where flow is not broken

background is applicable only for one feature file, for every feature file, background
will be different

hooks -

before and after - pre condition and post condition
hooks class will always be under steps package

tags - in order to execute scenarios/test cases in groupd, we use tags

hard coded data - it is strictly prohibited
data should be parameterized - scripts should be generic

from feature file, we can pass the data in scenario itself.
this type of scenario will be applicable to implement for just one data set

scripts should be generic, it should be data driven testing

when one script executes against multiple sets of data, then we call it data
driven testing
in order to implement ddt in cucumber, we use scenario outline with examples table

Page object model design pattern -

we create object repository of every page in individual class

Review class -

cucumber as a tool -

BDD approach - behavioral driven development approach

given - pre condition
when - to perform actions (click, send keys, drag and drop, dropdown etc)
then - expected result
and -  supporting tag that can be used with given, when, then

maven project -
build tool - it makes my project as a single build

configuration file - pom.xml (dependencies, plugins, run the code)

artifact id - project name
group id - organisation name

main - to write the code for development
test - to write the code for testing

test -
    java - for all technical stuff
    resources - for all non java stuff

we wrote scenarios in project
every single test case will be considered as one scenario

we use feature file to write scenarios -

feature file
step definition class
runner class



hooks - pro condition and post condition -

user story - Employee search

Background -
Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user enters valid username and password
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in
    When user clicks on PIM option
    And user clicks on employee list option

Scenario - search employee by id
    When user enters valid employee id
    And user clicks on search button
    Then user see the employee information


Scenario - search employee by name
    When user enters valid employee name
    And user clicks on search button
    Then user see the employee information

Hooks - in hooks, we implement pre condition and post condition

pre condition - opening the browser and launching the application
post condition - close the browser

Rule - hooks will be implemented in steps package

@Before - is pre condition
@After - is post condition

difference in between hooks and background

background is applicable for one feature file
hooks are applicable for entire project

we dont pass hard coded data in framework
cucumber allows me to pass data from feature file

my script should run against multiple sets of data
in order to achieve data driven testing

page object model design pattern

for every screen in the application, you create a page class for this screen and
keep all the locators (object repository) in it. to maintain the code reusability
and management

in page class, we use @find by annotation to locate the elements
we call them object repository

to initialize all the elements, we use constructor because contructor has been called
automatically when the object has been created.

in constructor, we call page factory and init elements

to utilize all page classes, we implement page initialiser class
we are calling this class in common methods class so that it can be called
everywhere.

Class 4 -

Recap -

background -

in every feature file, if steps are common in scenarios and the flow is not broken,
then we keep all these common steps in background.

background is applicable only for one feature file. It means, for every feature file,
background is different.

hooks - hooks class contains, pre condition and post condition for the entire project
hooks class will be a part of steps package

we can pass data from feature file in scenario itself through parameters

data driven testing -

we can pass data from scenario outline with examples table
in examples table, we pass username and password as an example
based on the total number of data sets, my scenario will be executed
if I have 3 data sets, my scenario will execute 3 times.

Page object model design pattern -

it allows us to create separate page classes for separate screens
in this page class, we keep all the locators(object repositories)
to use these elements, we initialize them using constructor

we create the objects of these page classes using page initializer class
we are extending this page initializer class in common methods so that all the objects
can be called in the beginning of the execution

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Case Study from start to finish
Login feature -

valid login test -
    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user enters valid username and password
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user is successfully logged in

invalid login test
    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user enters invalid username and password
    And user clicks on login button
    Then user should get error message on screen


invalid username and valid password
valid username and invalid password
valid username and blank password
blank username and valid password



Forgotten account
    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user clicks on fogotton account link
    Then user should be navigated to forgot account page

Signup for FB
    Given user is navigated to HRMS application
    When user clicks on signup for facebook page
    Then user should be navigated to signup page

We will create feature file with the name - Login.feature

in this file, I will write all the scenarios

create maven project -
look for test folder
create resources
create features
create login.feature
write all the scenarios

you need to create step definition -
to keep all step def's, create steps package
under steps package, LoginSteps class

for generating the step def, we need runner class
create runner package, inside this create runner class

inside runner class - you mention all the cucumber options

you keep step definitions in steps class

now you have to write the code.
you need common methods to call.
write common methods and mention all the methods you need in scripting

create config.properties file, create config directory, it will be under resources
create config reader class, create utils package
create constants class to keep all the paths

coming back to write the code in steps classes,
we need locators, common methods.

we need page classes, create pages package
implement Page object model design pattern

to run these things, we need Hooks class for pre condition and post condition
you keep it under steps package

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

data table -

data table is implement only for one step
hooks will execute 1 time
doesn't matter how many data sets you send here, it will execute your pre and post
condition

.xlsx - XSSFWorkBook
.xls - HSSFWorkBook

to validate specific field or string value we need assertions

in cucumber we use junit assertions

Assertions -

assertTrue - if something needs to be validated which exist or not
assertEquals - if we need to compare 2 values i.e expected and actual

Class 5 -

recap -

data table - when we need to add multiple data sets in single execution, unlike
examples table, we implement data table.

difference examples table vs data table

in examples table - hooks execute based on data sets
                    background executes based on data sets

in data table - hooks execute one time
                background executes 1 time


for data management and maintain confidentiality of data,
excel file - we pass data from excel file

list of maps -
for each loop, to get one map at one point of time
based on keys, we fetch values from excel file via excel reader class

assertions -
junit -

assert.asserttrue
assert.assertequals

all types of report you generate in framework will be a part of target folder

pretty keyword - it is used to print all the steps in console

in cucumber, when you take screenshot, it accepts screenshot in array of byte
byte[]

Scenario class in cucumber - it holds the complete information of execution done
which test case executed
which test case passed
which test case failed
what steps passed
what steps failed


rerun plugin - it is used to keep all the failed test case path details
which we pass under failedrunner class to give these test cases second chance

Class 6 -
recap -

reports -

pretty keyword - under plugin in runner class -
to print steps in the console

html report - under target folder, it generates the report

we executed our code from pom.xml file
maven surefile plugin is used to execute test cases from pom.xml file

maven cucumber reporter plugin - to generate report from pom.xml file
we need to attach screenshot in the report

screenshot method which accepts array of byte in cucumber
it gives us screenshot, and to add different names to the screenshot,
we use timestamp method

- sometimes, normal click doesn't work in the automation

logging -

stages/levels of logs -

info - to record the message which is captured during the execution
warn - it is going to inform you that you might have a problem in your code
error - it is used to inform you about the serious issue that your script might cause
fatal - it is used to inform serious issue like error but it stops the execution when the
seriousness of the code is high

clean
compile
verify
test
install
package are the phases of maven

mvn clean test is the command to run from CMD
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @smoke" to override the tag

----------------------------------

API -

Class 1

API - application programming interface


client - the one who makes the request
server - the one who responds to the request
API - the one who transfer request and response


client-server architecture

presentation - the layer what you see on the screen
application - the logic of application has been written
data - the data is available


1 tier architecture -


When the presentation layer, application layer and data layer available at one place, we call it 1 tier architecture.
calculator, notepad, ms paint, wordpad etc. Standalone application, desktop based application

2 tier architecture -

when the presentation layer is available at one place, application and data layer is available at another place.
ex - mac'd, dominoz, pizza, subway Walmart etc.

3 tier architecture -

When the presentation is available at one place, application layer is available at second place and data layer is available at third place.

n-tier architecture -

MMT, Facebook, IG, WhatsApp, Amazon, Ebay etc.

why do we need API's?

to make system developed in different programming languages communicate

to enhance the security of the application.

Class 2 -

Recap -

What is API - Application programming interface

it acts as an intermediator in between front end UI and back end DB.
it transfers the request from client to server and give the response back from server to client.

presentation layer - the one we see on the screen
application layer - the one where business logic has been written
data layer - the one where all the data is available


HRMS -
presentation layer - login screen
application layer - business logic
data layer - database

API -

client - server architecture

1 tier architecture - p,a,d layers at one place. ex - calculator, wordpad, desktop based application, standalone application

2 tier architecutre - ex - Walmart, pizza, macd, dominos etc.

3 tier architecture - ex - amazon, skyscanner etc

n tier architecture - expansion of 3 tier

why to use API's?
for security purpose
for making the system developed in different lang communicate


Swagger document - for API testing

dev team provides you this document


in order to make the complete API request I need 3 points

Address of the server
location of the API
end-point

what operations we need to perform in API?

CRUD - create, retrieve, update, delete

why do we need to perform this?

nyc - Greece - 123abc
bom - nyc - 123abc


$2000
Fabricio

we will test API manually


there are API's which are hosted over the internet - Webservices
there are API's which work without the internet - API

All the webservices are API's but all the API's are not webservices

types of web services -
	- REST - representational state transfer
	- SOAP - simple object access protocol

difference between rest and soap

we will test REST API's.

We will test REST api's

HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol -

it allows you to communicate with the applications over the internet

CRUD operations - HTTP has its own method -

create - POST
retrieve - GET
update - PUT
delete - DELETE

swagger document -


Address of the server - location of the api - end point



Base URI - BaseURL + end point
Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/getOneEmployee.php

admin user - we need to create this user at first

for creating an admin

prepare the request

Base URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/createUser.php
Type of method - POST
payload/body -

{
  "name": "adminbatch19",
  "email": "testbatch19@test.com",
  "password": "test@123"
}


token/sessions

public API
private API

private API -

authentication and authorization

who are you?
Are you allowed?
Show your ID?
What access you have?


JWT - json web token

	- bearer
	- mac
	- grants



Generating the token -

BaseURI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/generateToken.php

type of method = POST

payload/body =

{
  "email": "testbatch19@test123.com",
  "password": "test@123"
}

header =
content-type = application/json

response code = 200


header = eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.
payload = yJpYXQiOjE3MTk2ODUyNzAsImlzcyI6ImxvY2FsaG9zdCIsImV4cCI6MTcxOTcyODQ3MCwidXNlcklkIjoiNjYyMSJ9.
Signature = ZtMu-R8eH3ftLzLWPqIlmVxkWhLgPqjf4LG0QkHCoDs



create an employee

Base URI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/createEmployee.php
Type of method = POST
Payload/body =

{
  "emp_firstname": "manal",
  "emp_lastname": "premium",
  "emp_middle_name": "ms",
  "emp_gender": "F",
  "emp_birthday": "1976-06-16",
  "emp_status": "permanent",
  "emp_job_title": "QA Manager"
}


status code in response - 201



Class 3 -

recap -
	- CRUD -  create, retrieve, update, delete
	HTTP - hypertext transfer protocol

webservices - the API's which are hosted over the internet.

2 types
REST & SOAP

REST - we will work with REST

Base URI, Base URL, end point

centralized document - swagger document

to perform crud operations - we need admin user

to register admin user -

BaseURI = baseURL + endpoint
type of method =
body/payload =
headers =

authentication & authorization
token -

generate the token
Base URI = baseURL + endpoint
Type of method =
body/payload = use admin credentials
headers =

in response, we get JWT(JSON Web Token)

there are 3 parts in token - header, payload, signature (same message has  been transferred from server to client)

types of JWT -
	- Bearer
	- MAC
	- Grants


In order to perform crud operations -

Create a record in the database using API,

create an employee -

BaseURI = BaseURL + Endpoint
Type of method =
Payload/Body =
Headers =
Authorization = token


Get One Employee -

BaseURI = BaseURL + endpoint

hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/getOneEmployee.php

type of method = GET

employee_id = 108734A (When you have to select specific information from multiple info, you need query params)

authorization = token






get all job titles

BaseURI = BaseURL + endpoint

hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/jobTitle.php

type of method = GET

authorization = token

path parameter -



Create an employee -> Get an employee - done
Update an employee -> Get an updated employee
Delete an employee -> Get deleted employee



Update an employee -

BaseURI = hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/updateEmployee.php
Type of method = PUT
payload/body =

{

  "employee_id": "108734A",
  "emp_lastname": "carlston",
  "emp_middle_name": "james",

}

headers
content-type = application/json

authorization = token





hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/updatePartialEmplyeesDetails.php
Patch
body =

{
  "employee_id": "108734A",
  "emp_lastname": "carlston",
  "emp_middle_name": "james"
}

authorization = token


test your application in different env

dev
test/qa
staging
production


we parameterized all the environments
we update all the end points (globals)


if I am creating the employee
I should get 201 status code
I should get proper validation message
I should get exact same values in the body
I should get proper time also


Assertions
postman gives you in-built library for the assertions

chai library

pm - postman object
it allows us to use different methods for validation

pm.test
pm.expect
pm.request
pm.globals


in postman, we can write functions to validate the different fields, status code and time too.


JavaScript function, postman used

pm.test("name of the method", function () {
    the code you want to validate;
});


class 4 -

recap -

CRUD operations -

create - 201
retrieve - 200
update  - full update - 200 (PUT), partial update 201 (PATCH)
delete - 200

we keep all the requests in postman under collection.

to perform validations of request, we should write tests in postman.

chai assertion library (javascript language)
pm - postman object

pm.test  to write test
pm.expect - when we expect something to validation
pm.request -
pm.response - in order to get any value from response
pm.globals - if you wish to set any value globally during the request execution



pm.test("name of the method", function()){
the block of code}

we can validate -
status code
actual time of execution
any value in the response body
any key in the response body
any string in the response body
any headers in the response body


As a user if I create employee using API call, I should be able to validate

Acceptance criteria -
validate the body -  (actual key vs values)
validate the status code
validate the response headers
validate time of execution


json format

int i = 5 - java
const varName = value - js

revision -
Client - server
the one who makes the request
server is the one who responds to request
API - intermediator

client-server architecture
1 tier arch - desktop apps
2 tier arch - subway, macd, dominos
3 tier arch - MMT, HRMS
n tier arch - extended version of 3 tier arch

Base URI = base URL + endpoint

swagger document we need to get all the details of api testing

what operations we perform - CRUD

webservices - all the webservices are API's.

types of webservices -
REST
SOAP

REST API's.

HTTP protocol
POST
GET
PUT/PATCH
DELETE

we need to create admin user to perform all the operations

stateful - username/password
stateless - token

JWT - json web token
bearer
mac
grants

parts of token - header, payload, signature

status code -
201 - create
200 - get
200 - put
201 - patch

validations -
pm object - chai assertion library
pm.expect
pm.test
pm.response
pm.request
pm.globals

json conversion of response body
const vaeName = pm.response.json();

collectively - run the collection
in which I can include/exclude the api request

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API Automation -

Rest Assured - to automate API's

REST web service - the rest web services allows us to send data in JSON format.
JSON format - it consists of key and value pair

REST assured - it is a DSL (domain specific language)

Rest assured follows BDD approach

In Cucumber -
Given -  pre condition
When - actions
Then - expected result

In Rest assured -
Given - prepare the request
When - sending the request/hitting the endpoint
Then - validation of response/expected output

jsonpath = it returns the keys and values from the path

hamcrest matchers = it is a framework in API which helps us to create matchers for
body. we use it with junit and with other frameworks.

creating the employee
get the employee
update the employee
get updated employee

homework =
getAlljobTitles
getAllEmployee

Rest assured -
Cucumber -

integrate cucumber with rest assured

feature files - scenarios
step definitions - write the code for rest assured

Given the request is prepared for creating the employee
given.

class 6 -
recap - integrated Rest assured with cucumber
baseURI = baseURL (because we send endpoint separately)

we created separate API steps package

we have added API constants class here to pass all the endpoints and headers
